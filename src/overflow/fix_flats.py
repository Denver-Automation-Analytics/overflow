    """Algorithm 3 FlatEdges: This function locates flat cells which border on
    higher and lower terrain and places them into queues for further processing,
    as described in ยง2.2. Upon entry, (1) DEM contains the elevations of every cell
    or a value NoData for cells not part of the DEM. (2) Any cell without a local
    gradient is marked NoFlow in FlowDirs. At exit:
    (1) high_edges contains all the high edge cells (those flat cells adjacent to
    higher terrain) of the DEM, in no particular order.
    (2) low_edges contains all the low edge cells of the DEM, in no particular order.
