## This module, breach_paths_least_cost_cuda.py, is an experimental implementation of the least
## cost path algorithm for breaching pits in a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). It uses CUDA for
## parallel processing on a GPU. The module contains one main function: breach_paths_least_cost_cuda
## in addition to several supporting functions that are used by the main function.
##
## Memory Requirements
## The memory requirements for this module are primarily determined by three parameters:
##      - chunk_size
##      - search_radius
##      - max_pits
##
## chunk_size: This parameter determines the size of the chunks into which the input raster is
## divided for processing. Larger chunk sizes will require more memory but can potentially improve
## performance by reducing the overhead of launching CUDA kernels and overhead from copying data
## to / from the GPU. The memory required for storing the chunk data is proportional to chunk_size ** 2.
##
## search_radius: This parameter determines the size of the search window around each pit.
## The search window is a square with side length 2 * search_radius + 1. Therefore, the memory
## required for storing the cost, previous row, and previous column arrays is proportional to
## max_pits * (2 * search_radius + 1) ** 2.
##
## max_pits: This parameter determines the maximum number of pits that can be processed in a single call
## to the kernel. More pits will require more memory for storing the cost, previous row, and previous column
## arrays, but will also allow more efficient use of the GPU by processing more pits in parallel.
##
## Data Movement
## The data in this module moves from the host (CPU memory) to the device (GPU memory) in several steps:
##
## 1. The input DEM is read into host memory using GDAL.
##
## 2. The DEM is divided into chunks, and each chunk is processed separately. For each chunk, the pits in the
## chunk are identified and their locations are stored in a NumPy array. The costs array, previous row array,
## and previous column array are initialized and sent to the device to store the results of the least cost path
## algorithm.
##
## 3. The pits array and the chunk data are copied to device memory using cuda.to_device.
##
## 4. The breach_pits_in_chunk_cuda function is launched on the GPU. This function performs the least cost
## path algorithm to breach the pits in the chunk. The results are stored in device memory.
##
## 5. After all pits in a chunk have been processed, the results are copied back to host memory using
## d_dem.copy_to_host(). The breached DEM for the chunk is then written to the output raster.
